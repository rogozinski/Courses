# courses
This folder contains all work that I have done during the courses. In the future I will make seperate repository for each course. It might be more handy and easier to find. For now I don't really want to move files around so I won't mess up with my activity at GitHub.

This repository contains two folders. First one is from the ** React workshops for beginners ** that I have attented two years ago - ** WarsawJS **.
Second one is ** The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 ** by a ** Colt Steel ** at Udemy - currently I'm attending to his online classes. If you want to follow my learning proccess just have a look at the checklist below.
